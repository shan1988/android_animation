Nine Old Androids
=================

Android library for using the [Honeycomb (Android 3.0) animation API][1] on all
versions of the platform back to 1.0!

Note: `LayoutTransition` is present and it is not be possible to implement prior
to Android 3.0.



Usage
=====

The API is exactly the same as the [Honeycomb API][2], just change your imports
to use `com.nineoldandroids.XXX`.

Take a look at a few demos taken from the [platform ApiDemos][3] in the
`sample/` folder. You can also try it out on the [Play Store][4].

More information is available on [nineoldandroids.com][6].


Including In Your Project
-------------------------

This library is presented as a `.jar` file which you can include in the `libs/`
folder of your application. You can download the latest version from the
[GitHub downloads page][5].

If you are a Maven user you can easily include the library by specifying it as
a dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.nineoldandroids</groupId>
      <artifactId>library</artifactId>
      <version>2.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
